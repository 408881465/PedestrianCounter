This is a demo made for tracking pedestrian as I am making an attempt to track other vehicles. Starting out the problem with pedestrian is somewhat easier since their motions are more predictable.

This Project uses OpenCV 3.1.0 and Python.
The video I use as source file for analysis can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/7mbo35zrxd1aefz/peopleCounter.avi?dl=0

Thanks http://www.femb.com.mx/blog/ for his invaluable advices. I recommend looking at his tutorial and going through documentations on the OpenCV Python tutorial side to understand the code.
